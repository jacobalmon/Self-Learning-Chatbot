**Self Learning Chatbot** (Not Finished Yet)

Self Learning Chatbot that allows users to talk to and learn from the users.

**Introduction:**

My project allows users to talk to a chatbot. 
The chatbot will learn information that the user inputs. 
The server for the chatbot is set up using the 'Flask' framework in Python.
The Flask framework creates a server so that the client can send requests to the server, and the server can respond to the client.
The project's Artificial Intelligence is built using NLTK for natural language processing such as parsing the client's message into tokens looking for keywords, so it can understand what the user is asking/talking about.
The Chatbot is on website running as a local host when the Flask server ran.
